# SoFiA-GPU-Test

This repository contains a test implementation of GPU acceleration of the S+C finder in the Source Finding Application (SoFiA), specifically the filtering (with CUDA and OPEN-CL) and the noise computations (only with CUDA). The implementation was supplied by Carlos Carreras from the Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI) at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM) and is supplied as is and without any testing or warranty in the hope that some people may find it useful.

Please navigate to the SoFiA repository at https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA-2/ instead if you are looking for the latest stable version of SoFiA 2 for your source finding needs.
