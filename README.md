# SoFiA-GPU-Test

This repository contains a test implementation of GPU acceleration of the S+C finder in the Source Finding Application (SoFiA), specifically the filtering (with CUDA and OPEN-CL) and noise computation (only with CUDA). The implementation was supplied by Carlos Carreras from the Integrated Systems Laboratory (LSI) at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM) and is supplied as is and without any testing or warranty in the hope that some people may find it useful. The file `SoFiA-2-2.5.0_gpu.zip` contains the actual source code, while the PDF document `SoFiA2_GPU_AMIGA7.pdf` contains detailed information on the implementation.

If you are looking for the latest stable version of SoFiA for your source finding needs, please navigate to the SoFiA 2 repository at https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA-2/ instead.
